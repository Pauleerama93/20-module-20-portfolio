                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Paul Nelson, and I am a passionate new developer eager to tackle coding challenges and build innovative solutions. I discovered my love for programming when I went through junior college for engineering and discovered I loved the computer side of the degree which included: SolidWorks for 3D modeling and a c++ class that was requird for my degree. Since then, I have gone through a coding bootcamp put on by UC Berkeley and have been immersed in the world of web development.
